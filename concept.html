                    <p class="video-title">How Do Rumors Get Started?</p>
                    <P>

                    <h4 class="section">Fake News</h4>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fake narratives disguised as news stories/publications intended to deceive readers</li>
                            <li>Fake News are often created by deceivers with no intention to resemble facts</li>
                            <li>Before social media, Fake News were mostly used by governments for propaganda, so as to assert its influence on the public and create a certain belief among citizens (political gains)</li>
                            <li>The rise of social media helped create an environment where everyone could upload and/or promote false ideas as if they were truths among users</li>
                            <li>People could be paid to upload fake news on behalf of another person. There are automated programs online that publish auto-generated fake news as well</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4 class="section">Misinformation</h4>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>False or inaccurate information is spread innocently</li>
                                <li>Errors made when retrieving facts (may not be intentional, people sharing the misinformation believe it is true before sharing</li>
                                <li>Misinformation is especially common on social media, where users could easily upload and reshare content (that’s why misinformation spreads rapidly online). Unlike traditional media, there are not many ‘gatekeepers’ to fact-check everything before uploading. Moreover, there are no consequences for people who upload or spread information because everyone is anonymous. It is very difficult to make sure everything uploaded onto social media is factual and accurate too given that millions of posts are being uploaded every single day</li>
                                <li>Tech companies have low or no incentives to eliminate misinformation on social media platforms as misinformation attracts users’ interaction which is profitable for the tech giants. Thus, high-profile people like celebrities will not bear consequences for spreading misinformation as well, as they attract more users’ engagement, which means more money for the tech corporations</li>
